A simple Tower Defense Game built with Pygame

# The Game

The Goal of the game is to simply last as many levels as possible by placing soliders and using upgrades.

- To place soldiers or trap, press the red square, which will turn purple. 
- This means you are in placing mode, so every click (as long as it is legal), will place a soldier or trap. 
- Pressing the button again puts you out of placing mode.

- You can also use upgrades to increase the size of each soldiers projectiles and the speed of their projectiles. 
- This can be done by buying upgrades. Each upgrade will increase the cost of the next.

- As you kill more enemies, they will get stronger and faster (indicated by color). 
- If an enemy passes through the path you lose a health point. 
- If you lose of all of your hp you lose! 
- At the end of the game, the ending screen will indicate how many enemies you killed and how many levels you passed.
