Tower Defense Game

Author: Jackson Davis

PID: 730335247


Requirements:
    -pygame
    -pygame_gui

How to play:
    - Soldiers can be placed by pressing the placing button in the top right of the screen.
        - The button should turn purple, indicating that you are placing a soldier.
        - You may now press anywhere (besides the roads and button areas) to place a soldier.
        - When you are finished placing, press the button again to stop placing.

    - Traps work identically to soldiers, but are placed on the road instead.

    - Upgrades are on the top left, and can be bought by pressing their respective buttons.

Concepts used:
    - For Loops (game loop, game logic)
    - Dictionaries(game logic, tracking projectiles)
    - Classes(enemies, fighters, projectiles)
    - f strings (buttons, menus)

Possible improvements:
    - My main issue is that I have too many dependencies, causing small errors to crash the game.
    - To expand the game further, I would most likely need to completely restructure my code
        - As of now, it is disorganized and convuluted to work with, which makes expansion difficult.
    - Projectiles are a bit gimmicky, and dont move linearly towards enemies as they should.
